                                <p class="team-desc">Progress for me has never been a dream. It has always been a distant reality and once one milestone is achieved, there is always another one waiting to be crossed. It is with this belief that I started Saimbot ship contractors limited, a company that is in the business of Waste Management. Through the years it has grown to be the market leader in the Waste Management Industry. 
                                As much as I am so ambitious, wanting to push my company to more prosperous milestones, to make it a global player I also perceive my company as an entity that could bring a difference to the community by being environmental conscious and economically empowering the community. 
                                I understand that the journey of Saimbot is never ending. But with the support of my team and clients, I am confident that the company will continue to scale milestones of excellence for years to come and continue touching even more lives.</p>
